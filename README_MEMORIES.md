# üìñ Memories Timeline - Quick Start Guide

## What is this?

The Memorly backend provides:
- **Memories Timeline** - Automatically tracks and displays all user activities in chronological order
- **AI Chat Assistant** - Intelligent memory assistant that helps users recall details and answer questions based on their stored memories
- **Dashboard** - Comprehensive user statistics and recent activities

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. For Frontend Developers

**Fetch the Timeline:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/memories/timeline?page=1&limit=20', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
// data.timeline = activities grouped by date
// data.pagination = pagination info
```

**Complete React Example:**
See `MEMORIES_API_GUIDE.md` for full integration examples including:
- Timeline component with pagination
- Infinite scroll
- Activity type filtering
- Statistics dashboard
- Manual sync

### 2. For Backend Developers

**Understanding the System:**
- Activities are automatically tracked from File, Chat, Message, and Friend models
- The Memory model serves as a cache (auto-synced in background)
- Timeline is built by querying source models directly
- No manual intervention needed

**Read This:**
- `MEMORIES_TIMELINE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - How it works under the hood

### 3. For Project Managers/QA

**What Gets Tracked:**
- ‚úÖ File uploads (images/videos)
- ‚úÖ Chat creation
- ‚úÖ Messages sent by user
- ‚úÖ Friend requests sent
- ‚úÖ Friend requests accepted
- ‚úÖ Friend requests rejected

**Testing the Feature:**
1. Create some activities (upload file, create chat, etc.)
2. Call `GET /memories/timeline`
3. Verify activities appear in timeline
4. Test pagination with `?page=2`
5. Test filtering with `?activityType=file_upload`

## üîë Key Endpoints

### Get Dashboard (Recommended for Home Screen)
```
GET /memories/dashboard
```
Returns everything: statistics, recent activities, and activity breakdown in one call.

### Get Timeline
```
GET /memories/timeline?page=1&limit=20&activityType=file_upload
```

### Get Statistics
```
GET /memories/stats
```

### Manual Sync (One-time setup)
```
POST /memories/sync
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è First-Time Setup

### After Deploying to Production

If you have existing users with historical data, run a one-time sync:

**Option 1: Via API (Recommended)**
```bash
# For each user, call:
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/memories/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN"
```

**Option 2: Manual Script**
```javascript
// Run this in your MongoDB shell or Node.js
const users = await User.find({});
for (const user of users) {
  // Make API call to sync endpoint for each user
}
```

**Note:** After this initial sync, everything is automatic!

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### 1. Display User Timeline
Show users what they've done recently:
```typescript
fetch('/memories/timeline?limit=10')
```

### 2. Show Today's Activities
```typescript
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
fetch(`/memories/date/${today}`)
```

### 3. File Upload History
```typescript
fetch('/memories/timeline?activityType=file_upload')
```

### 4. Activity Statistics
```typescript
fetch('/memories/stats')
// Returns counts by activity type
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Timeline is empty
- Check if user has any activities (files, chats, messages, friends)
- Run manual sync: `POST /memories/sync`
- Check server logs for errors

### Activities missing
- The system auto-syncs on every timeline fetch
- Or manually trigger: `POST /memories/sync`
- Check if activities exist in source models (File, Chat, etc.)

### Slow response
- Use pagination (`?limit=20`)
- Use activity type filter (`?activityType=...`)
- Check database indexes are created

---

## üí° Tips

### Performance
- Start with `limit=20` for good performance
- Use infinite scroll instead of loading all at once
- Cache recent timeline on frontend

### UX
- Group activities by date (already done in API)
- Show relative dates (Today, Yesterday, etc.)
- Add pull-to-refresh on mobile

### Features
- Add search within timeline
- Export timeline as PDF
- Share memories with friends
